# 🛒 Tarkov Grocery List

Because who doesn't need another way to organize their virtual shopping spree in a war-torn Russian city?

## [Live Demo](https://aesisify.github.io/tarkov-grocery-list/)

## What is this?

A hastily cobbled together shopping list for Escape from Tarkov items that I wrote in approximately the time it takes to cook instant ramen. It uses the amazing [tarkov.dev](https://tarkov.dev) API because those folks are the real MVPs keeping the Tarkov community well-fed with data.

## Features

- ✨ Search for items (yes, it actually works)
- 📃 Add items to your list
- 💰 See best buy/sell prices
- 📊 Sort items by various criteria
- 💾 Local storage so your list survives rage quits
- 🎨 Dark mode because we're not savages

## Why?

Because spreadsheets are so 2023, and I needed something to do while waiting for my scav cooldown.

- [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io) - The library that makes this pop
- My lack of impulse control - For deciding to build this instead of actually playing the game
