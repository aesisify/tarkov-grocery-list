# 🛒 Tarkov Grocery List

Because who doesn't need another way to organize their virtual shopping spree in a war-torn Russian city?

## What is this?

A hastily cobbled together shopping list for Escape from Tarkov items that I wrote in approximately the time it takes to cook instant ramen. It uses the amazing [tarkov.dev](https://tarkov.dev) API because those folks are the real MVPs keeping the Tarkov community well-fed with data.

## Features

- ✨ Search for items (yes, it actually works)
- 📃 Add items to your list
- 💰 See best buy/sell prices
- 📊 Sort items by various criteria
- 💾 Local storage so your list survives rage quits
- 🎨 Dark mode because we're not savages
- 🚀 Built with HTMX because why not

## Why?

Because spreadsheets are so 2023, and I needed something to do while waiting for my scav cooldown.

## Credits

- [tarkov.dev](https://tarkov.dev) - The absolute legends providing the API that makes this possible
- My lack of impulse control - For deciding to build this instead of actually playing the game

## License

Feel free to use this however you want. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces! 🎉

## Contributing

Did you seriously read this far? Well, if you want to contribute, go ahead! Just keep in mind this was built in less time than it takes to do a Factory run with full gear.
